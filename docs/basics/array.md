## Definition

Just like in JavaScript, you can work with arrays of values in TypeScript. However, with TypeScript, you can also specify the type of elements contained in the array.

```typescript
let list1: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let list2: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3]; // Alternate syntax using generics
